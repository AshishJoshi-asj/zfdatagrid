Format is a way to format content using plugins.

This is special useful to format date, time, bool, currency, and any other content.

You must first register you format whiting the grid:

{{{
$grid->addFormatterDir('My/Grid/Formatter','My_Grid_Formatter');   
}}}

After this you can start using you format plugins.

{{{
$grid->updateColumn('amount',array('format'=>"currency"));   
}}}

The ZFDatagrid will look for a class called !My_Grid_Formatter_Currency and for a method called format().

The field value will be passed to the format method.

Alternatively you can pass optional params to the format.

{{{
$grid->updateColumn('amount', array('format'=> array('currency',array('arg'=>1, 'arg'=>'{{amount}}'))));   
}}}  

_Note_ The second argument will be converted in the value for the amount field. You can use {{field}} for any field
