#summary Documentation for Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid class

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

This is documentation for *[http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html jqGrid]* frontend implementation for *ZFDatgrid library*. Look at this *[http://www.k2s.sk/grid/jqgrid example]* to see it in action.

The actual class implementation is developed under own [http://code.google.com/p/zfdatagrid/source/browse/#svn/branches/jqGrid ZFDatagrid branch]. It will be merged into trunk when completed and accepted by [http://code.google.com/u/pao.fresco/ project owner].

*Current plans:*
  * keep jqGrid frontend as much as possible compatible with HTML Table frontend
  * allow to pass all configuration options of jqGrid from PHP
  * add PHP functions which will provide easy way to complex jqGrid functionality
  * evaluate what parts of Bvb should be improved to use full power of booth libraries
  * provide documentation and examples

*Future plans:*
  * user settings persistence - saving of the state (ordering, current page, filters, etc.) in cookie
  * support [http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:advanced_searching Advanced searching]
  * allow formatters to change jqGrid settings and work with different deploy classes (need Bvb redesign)
    * create set of useful formatters
  * CRUD operations
  * evaluate possibility and usefulness to support:
    * (jqgrid) filter input controls (text and select is supported, but date, date range, etc. should be added)
    * (jqgrid) column chooser
    * (jqgrid) column reorder
    * (jqgrid) summary footer row
    * (jqgrid) autoloading when scrolling
    * (jqgrid) Adjacency List Model
    * (jqgrid) subforms
    * (jqgrid) tree
    * (Bvb) horizontal row

== Installation ==
In general the project which wants to use {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid}}} class has to accomplish:
  * include path set to directories where following libraries are located:
    * Zend
    * ZendX
    * Bvb (ZFDataGrid) - *you have to use the jqGrid branch*
{{{
svn checkout http://zfdatagrid.googlecode.com/svn/branches/jqGrid/trunk/library/Bvb Bvb
}}}
  * full jqGrid library accessible from URL
    * download from http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6 (check all modules, we are not testing with other configuration)
    * uncompress to publicly accessible folder (you will not need the src subfolder)
  * configure {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid}}} to use your URL pointing to folder with jqGrid library (best place is to do it in bootsrap)
{{{
Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid::$jqgridLibPath = $myurl;
}}}
  * use {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid}}} instead of {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_Table class}}}
  * if you already used ZFDatagrid in your project and simple replace of {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_Table}}} with {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid}}} should work
  * *you have to call function {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_Table::ajax()}}} before {{{deploy()}}}*

== Code ==
  * at this moment you need to use [http://code.google.com/p/zfdatagrid/source/browse/#svn/branches/jqGrid jqGrid branch] from repository to use this class
  * code formating follows the Zend standard and is checked regularly with [http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer PHP_CodeSniffer]
  * code documentation on [http://www.k2s.sk/gridapi/library/Bvb/Grid/Deploy/Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid.class.html http://www.k2s.sk/gridapi] was generated by [http://www.phpsimpledoc.org/ phpSimpleDoc]

= Usage =

I assume that you read actual [http://code.google.com/p/zfdatagrid/downloads/list ZFDatagrid manual].

== Steps to configure jqGrid ==
You will find all necessarily steps in our [http://www.k2s.sk/grid/jqgrid example] (*[http://www.k2s.sk/grid/jqgrid/code view code]*).

  # define {{{Zend_Db_Select}}} object and pass it to grid
  # update column options
  # configure Bvb grid behaviour (available in {{{Bvb_Grid_DataGrid}}})
  # configure jqGrid options {{{Bvb_Grid_Deploy_JqGrid}}}
  # set ajax ID
  # deploy and display in view

== Column options ==
=== Common column options ===
=== jqGrid column options ===
== ZFDatagrid options ==
=== Common grid options ===
=== jqGrid grid options ===

This extension to ZFDatagrid would not exists without the superior [http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki jqGrid library]. You may be interested in their original commercial solutions at http://www.trirand.net/.
