#summary Using ajax to navigate trough your grid

= Introduction =

Most of the so called "web 2.0"websites make use of ajax so speed things up and to add fancy flowers.

ZFDatagrid also supports ajax for the most common actions (pagination, sorting, filtering)

All you need to do is:

{{{
$this->setAjax('someId');
}}}

That's it. A `<div>` will be created with the 'someId' id.

You can disable ajax using
{{{
$this->setAjax(false);
}}}
