#summary Setting up Paging

= Introduction =

Setting the number of records per page is one simple and easy task. You can make two choices:
 * Limit the amount of records displayed
 * Show all records at once

No matter what choice you made, it's done with the same method.

After your grid is instantiated just use the !SetPagination() method

{{{
$grid->setPatination(10)//Will show 10 records per page
$grid->setPagination(0)//Will show all records in one page
}}}

<font color="red">*Attention:*</font> Pagination won't take any effect when you explicitly set a limit in your query clause

Examle:
{{{
$select = new Zend_Db_Select();
$select->from('table')
$select->limit(19);
}}}
Using the above code all 19 records will be shown in one page, without giving the user the ability to remove it


*The default value for pagination is _20_*
