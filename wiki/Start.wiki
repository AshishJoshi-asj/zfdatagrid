=Your first grid=

 # First, download the latest version from the  [http://code.google.com/p/zfdatagrid/downloads/list Downloads] tab
 # Move the *_Bvb_* folder to your library
 # In your controller create a new grid instance: 
 {{{
 $grid = Bvb_Grid::factory('table',array(),$id='');
 //The first argument is the default deploy class. 
 //The second argument is a Zend_Config instance or an array 
 //The third argument is the grid id. Optional if you don't will use multiple grids per page
 }}}
 # Set images url (used for sorting, export, etc.). You can download the default [http://code.google.com/p/zfdatagrid/downloads/list here]
 {{{
    $grid>setImagesUrl('/grid/public/images/');//Change this value to match your needs
 }}}
 # Set the source => check this page for detailed [Bvb_Grid_Source info]
 {{{
 $select = $this->getDb()->select->from('table');
 $grid->setSource(new Bvb_Grid_Source_Zend_Select($select));
 }}}
 # Deploy it
 {{{
 $this->view->grid = $grid->deploy();
 }}}
 and in your view:
 {{{
 echo $this->grid;
 }}}


After setting the source you can customize the fields using the updateColumn() method
{{{
$grid->updateColumn('field',array('options'));
}}}

<font color="red">_*ATTENTION:*_</font> The first argument for the updateColumn() method is always the output field and not the field name. If your raw query is something like this: 
{{{
"Select name, age, status as something FROM table"; 
}}}
You must use _somehting_ to refer to the _status_ field. If your are using joins is *YOUR* job to properly give fields alias, otherwise if you have two fields from different tables with the same name, the last will override any previous.
