{{{
$grid->setSource(new Bvb_Grid_Source_Json($file, $loop, $columns));
}}}

Where 

{{{
$file//Is the json location: http://zfdatagrid.com/feed/ or string
$loop //The node where the data you want to fetch.
$columns//The fields names. If null the node name will be used
}}}

||You can now use your grid with all options as you expected, except CRUD operations.||
