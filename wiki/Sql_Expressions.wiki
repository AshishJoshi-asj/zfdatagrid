#summary Data summary for columns

= Introduction =

The expression result will be presented before the pagination as a new table row (tr) and bellow to matching field. Using SQL expressions is as easy as:

{{{
$grid->sqlexp = array(
            'field’ =>array(
                'functions' => array('SUM'),
                'value' => 'price*number',
                'format'=>'number' //Format is optional
            )
        );

}}}


*Note:* You can also have the ‘sqlexp’ when using the array adapter. At this moment only six functions are supported (min, max, avg, sum, product, count)
