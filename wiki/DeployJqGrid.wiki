= Introduction =

This is documentation for *[http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html jqGrid]* frontend implementation for *ZFDatgrid library*. Look at this *[http://www.k2s.sk/grid/jqgrid example]* to see it in action.

*Current plans:*
  * keep jqGrid frontend as much as possible compatible with HTML Table frontend
  * allow to pass all configuration options of jqGrid from PHP
  * add PHP functions which will provide easy way to complex jqGrid functionality
  * evaluate what parts of Bvb should be improved to use full power of booth libraries
  * provide documentation and examples

*Future plans:*
  * support [http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:advanced_searching Advanced searching]
  * allow formatters to change jqGrid settings and work with different deploy classes (need Bvb redesign)
    * create set of useful formatters
  * CRUD operations
  * evaluate possibility and usefulness to support:
    * (jqgrid) subforms
    * (jqgrid) tree
    * (jqgrid) autoloading when scrolling
