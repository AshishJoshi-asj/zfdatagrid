#summary Different presentation for different values
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =
Let's imagine you are presenting a report. And as any report it will have a range of values. Some positives and, how knows, some negatives.

ZFDatagrid provides two methods for altering CSS classes based on conditions.


= Details =

==Per Row==

Lets imagine you want to add a CSS class on every row in which population value is less greater than 20000. 

{{{
$grid->setClassRowCondition("{{Population}} > 20000","green");
}}}

The first argument is the condition. As noticed use the {{}} to get fields values.


*NOTE:* When comparing strings please remember to include the '' around the field name, so PHP can treat that as a string and not a number.

You can add a third argument, that is also a class that will be applied if the condition is not true.

{{{
$grid->setClassRowCondition("{{Population}} > 20000","green","orange");
}}}

== Per Column==

Is the same behavior as for a Row, but you need to specify the column that the condition will be applied.

{{{
$grid->addClassCellCondition('Population',"{{Population}} > 200000","red");
}}}

As expected, you can also add a third argument in case the condition is not true

{{{
$grid->addClassCellCondition('Population',"{{Population}} > 200000","red","green");
}}}
