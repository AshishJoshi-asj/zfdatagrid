#summary Manipulate how filters works...

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

By default ZFDatagrid will try to provide the user the best way to filter results. Per example, if you have a _enum_ field in your database, instead a text input, a select menu will be presented to the user. 

= Do more = 

You can enhance filters by specifying them "manually":


//Create a dropdown for user selection
{{{
$filters = new Bvb_Grid_Filters();        
$filters->addFilter('username',array('values'=>array('key'=>'pairs','another'=>'value')));
$grid->addFilters($filters);   
}}}

The field will be searched by the key and the user will see the value.


= Auto Filters=

One useful feature can be the distinct fields. Once specified the system will select all distinct values for a given field and then present them to the users as a dropdown menu. Making their life much more easy.

{{{
$filters->addFilter('username'=> array('distinct'=>array( 'field'=>'id' ,  'name'=>'username')));    
}}}

That will result in a SQL query like this:

{{{
SELECT id as key, name as value FROM <table> WHERE <previous conditions>
}}}

=Callback=
Using a callback will greatly improve you ability to enhance your filtering system


{{{
$filters->addFilter('lastname',array('callback'=>array('function'=>array($this,
'customFilter'),'params'=>array('XXX','YYY'))));
}}}

Along with the params you defined, 3 more ill be merged.

 * field => The field name
 * value => The field value
 * select => The select Object (!Zend_Db_Select or other)

<font color="red">*ATTENTION: *</font> Is YOUR responsibility to apply any condition to the select object

<font color="red">*ATTENTION2: *</font> Any field not specified when adding filters will have search disabled.
